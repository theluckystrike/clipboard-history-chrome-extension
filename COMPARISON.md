## Detailed Comparison

### vs. Windows Clipboard History (Win+V)

Windows 10 and 11 include a built-in clipboard history activated with `Win+V`. It is convenient because there is nothing to install, and it supports images and files.

However, it stores only about 25 items, has no search capability, and is limited to Windows. Clipboard History stores 10,000 items with instant full-text search and works on any operating system where Chrome runs -- macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, and Windows.

If you need more than a handful of recent items, or if you work on a Mac or Linux machine, the Chrome extension is a significant upgrade.

### vs. macOS

macOS provides no built-in clipboard history at all. The system clipboard holds exactly one item. Apple's Universal Clipboard lets you share that single item between Apple devices, but it does not maintain a history.

Clipboard History gives Mac users a searchable clipboard history without installing a standalone macOS application. It runs inside Chrome and works immediately.

### vs. CopyQ

CopyQ is a free, open source desktop clipboard manager that captures from all applications, supports images and rich text, and is scriptable with JavaScript. It is a powerful tool for users who need system-wide clipboard management.

Clipboard History is simpler and more focused. It runs inside Chrome with no desktop application to install or configure, requires no system tray process, and has a clean interface designed for quick access. If your work happens primarily in a browser, the Chrome extension is faster to set up and easier to use. If you need to capture clipboard content from Photoshop, terminal emulators, and other native applications, CopyQ is the better choice.

### vs. Ditto

Ditto is a popular free clipboard manager for Windows with network sync between PCs and support for images and rich text. Like CopyQ, it captures from all applications.

Clipboard History is cross-platform (any OS running Chrome) and requires no installation beyond adding a Chrome extension. Ditto is a stronger choice if you are committed to Windows and need system-wide capture with LAN sync.

## When to Use Clipboard History

Clipboard History is the best fit when:

- You work primarily in a web browser
- You need clipboard history on macOS, Linux, or ChromeOS
- You want a simple tool that works out of the box with no configuration
- You store a large number of clips (up to 10,000) and need to search them
- Privacy matters to you -- local-only storage, open source, no analytics
- You are on a Chromebook or a machine where you cannot install desktop applications

## When to Use Something Else

A desktop clipboard manager may be a better fit when:

- You need to capture clipboard content from non-browser applications
- You need image and rich-text clipboard support
- You need to sync clipboard history across machines over a local network

You can also use Clipboard History alongside a desktop clipboard manager. They do not conflict with each other.
