# Use Cases

Clipboard History is designed for anyone who copies and pastes regularly. Here is how different groups use it in their daily work.

## Developers

Developers copy and paste constantly -- code snippets, error messages, stack traces, terminal output, API endpoints, configuration values, and documentation URLs.

**How Clipboard History helps:**

- **Code snippets** -- Copy a function signature from one file and a type definition from another. Both are saved. Use the Code filter to see only code clips.
- **Error messages** -- Copy an error from the console, search for a solution, copy the fix. Need the original error? It is still in your history.
- **Terminal commands** -- Pin your most-used commands: Docker commands, SSH connections, deployment scripts. Paste them with two clicks.
- **API responses** -- Copy JSON responses from different endpoints. Filter by JSON type to compare them side by side.
- **Refactoring** -- Moving code between files means copying multiple pieces. All of them remain accessible in your history.
- **PR descriptions** -- Pin your team's PR template so you can paste it every time you open a pull request.
- **Stack Overflow** -- Copy solutions from multiple answers. Try each one. The others are still in your history if the first does not work.

## Writers and Content Creators

Writers work with text from many sources -- research quotes, draft paragraphs, URLs, notes, and reference material. Clipboard History turns your clipboard into a working scratchpad.

**How Clipboard History helps:**

- **Research** -- Copy quotes, statistics, and key passages from sources while reading. All are saved and searchable for when you start writing.
- **Drafting** -- Write a paragraph, cut it, write a different version. Both versions remain in your history. Nothing is lost.
- **Citations** -- Copy author names, titles, and URLs as you go. Search your history when building your bibliography.
- **Social media** -- Pin hashtag sets, post templates, and frequently used captions. Post across platforms without retyping.
- **Editing** -- Copy text you plan to rework. The original is always available if you want to revert.

## Virtual Assistants and Remote Workers

Virtual assistants send similar messages and fill similar forms dozens of times per day. Clipboard History eliminates repetitive typing.

**How Clipboard History helps:**

- **Email templates** -- Pin your greeting, closing, and full email templates. Open history, click, paste.
- **Client information** -- Copy a client's name, email, or account number once. It stays in your history for the rest of the session.
- **Canned responses** -- Pin your top 10-20 responses to common questions. Access them in seconds instead of searching through a document.
- **Meeting links** -- Pin your Zoom or Google Meet URL. Paste it into every invite and chat message without hunting for it.
- **Multi-tool workflows** -- Virtual assistants switch between email, CRM, project management tools, and chat. Your clipboard history persists across all Chrome tabs.

## Students and Researchers

Students juggle notes, quotes, citations, and assignment content across multiple sources and documents.

**How Clipboard History helps:**

- **Research papers** -- Copy data points and quotes from journal articles and web sources throughout a research session. Search your history to find them when writing.
- **Citations** -- Copy bibliographic details from databases. Your history keeps them accessible when formatting references.
- **Lecture notes** -- Copy key concepts from online presentations or learning platforms. Review them by searching your history.
- **Group projects** -- Copy and share content between Google Docs, Slack, and email. Everything you have copied is available.
- **Coding assignments** -- Pin starter code templates, keep test inputs accessible, and save error messages for debugging.

## Customer Support

Support agents copy and paste troubleshooting steps, knowledge base links, and account details throughout every shift.

**How Clipboard History helps:**

- **Canned responses** -- Pin standard troubleshooting steps, greeting messages, and escalation templates. Paste them instantly instead of searching a help doc.
- **Knowledge base links** -- Pin links to your most-referenced support articles. Share them in tickets and chats with one click.
- **Account details** -- Copy a customer's information once. It stays in your history as you work across the ticketing system, internal tools, and chat.
- **Escalation notes** -- Pin your team's escalation template so you can paste and fill it in quickly.
- **Shift handoffs** -- Export your clipboard history at the end of a shift to share context with the next agent.
