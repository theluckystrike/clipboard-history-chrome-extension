# Clipboard History Pro

**Never lose copied text again.** Clipboard History Pro saves everything you copy and gives you instant search and keyboard shortcuts to find and reuse past clips.

How many times have you copied something, then copied something else, and lost the first item? Clipboard History Pro keeps a running history of everything you copy so you can always get it back.

## Why Clipboard History Pro?

Your operating system clipboard only holds one item at a time. Every time you copy something new, the previous item is gone. For developers, writers, researchers, and anyone who works with text, this is a constant source of lost work and wasted time.

Clipboard History Pro extends your clipboard into a searchable history. Copy as many items as you need, then find any of them instantly with search or keyboard shortcuts.
