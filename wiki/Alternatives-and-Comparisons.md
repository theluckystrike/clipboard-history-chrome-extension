# Alternatives and Comparisons

There are several clipboard managers available across different platforms. This page offers an honest comparison so you can choose the right tool for your workflow.

## Clipboard History (this extension) vs. Other Options

### Windows Clipboard History (Win+V)

Windows 10 and 11 include a built-in clipboard history that you can access with `Win+V`.

**Advantages of Windows Clipboard History:**
- Built into the OS, no installation required
- Supports images and files, not just text
- Optional cloud sync with your Microsoft account

**Advantages of Clipboard History (Chrome extension):**
- Works on any OS (macOS, Linux, ChromeOS) -- not just Windows
- Stores up to 10,000 items vs. roughly 25 items on Windows
- Full-text search across your entire history
- Pin and star clips for quick access
- Filter by content type (text, URL, code, email)
- Export history as JSON
- Open source and fully auditable

**Best for:** If you only work on Windows and rarely need to search old clips, Win+V may be enough. If you work across operating systems, need to search through a large history, or want to keep clips organized, the Chrome extension is a better fit.

### macOS Clipboard

macOS has no built-in clipboard history. The system clipboard holds only the most recent item. Apple's Universal Clipboard syncs between Apple devices, but it does not maintain a history.

**Advantages of Clipboard History (Chrome extension):**
- Provides the clipboard history macOS lacks entirely
- Works in Chrome regardless of which Mac apps you use
- Stores 10,000 items with search, pins, and stars
- No third-party app installation needed outside Chrome

**Best for:** Mac users who do most of their work in Chrome and want clipboard history without installing a separate macOS application.

### CopyQ (Desktop App)

CopyQ is a free, open source, cross-platform clipboard manager that runs as a desktop application.

**Advantages of CopyQ:**
- Captures from all applications, not just Chrome
- Supports images, HTML, and other formats
- Scriptable with JavaScript commands
- Advanced editing and formatting tools

**Advantages of Clipboard History (Chrome extension):**
- No desktop application to install or manage
- Works instantly in Chrome with a single click
- Simpler interface with less configuration needed
- Lighter resource usage (no background process)
- Works on Chromebooks and other locked-down environments where you cannot install desktop apps

**Best for:** CopyQ is excellent if you need clipboard management across your entire operating system. Clipboard History is better if your workflow is primarily browser-based and you value simplicity.

### Ditto (Windows Desktop App)

Ditto is a popular free clipboard manager for Windows.

**Advantages of Ditto:**
- Captures from all Windows applications
- Supports images and rich text
- Network sync between multiple Windows PCs
- Powerful search and grouping

**Advantages of Clipboard History (Chrome extension):**
- Cross-platform (works on Mac, Linux, ChromeOS)
- No desktop app installation needed
- Runs entirely inside Chrome with zero configuration
- Open source with a modern Manifest V3 architecture
- 10,000-item capacity with export

**Best for:** Ditto is a strong choice for Windows-only users who need system-wide clipboard management. Clipboard History is better for users who work primarily in Chrome or need cross-platform support.

## Summary

Clipboard History occupies a specific niche: it gives you a powerful, searchable clipboard history that works inside Chrome on any operating system, without installing a desktop application. It stores far more items than built-in OS solutions, and it is simpler to set up than full desktop clipboard managers.

If you live in Chrome, it is the most convenient option. If you need clipboard management across all applications on your system, a desktop tool like CopyQ or Ditto may be more appropriate -- or you can use both.
