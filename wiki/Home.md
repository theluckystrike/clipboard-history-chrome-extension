# Clipboard History -- Documentation

Welcome to the official wiki for **Clipboard History**, a free and open source Chrome extension that automatically saves everything you copy.

Your operating system clipboard only holds one item at a time. Clipboard History fixes that by saving up to 10,000 items with instant search, pinned favorites, starred clips, and keyboard shortcuts. All data stays local in your browser -- nothing is ever sent to any server.
