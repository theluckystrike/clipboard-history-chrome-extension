# Use Cases

Clipboard History is useful for anyone who copies and pastes regularly. Here is how different groups use it.

## Developers

Software developers copy and paste constantly -- code snippets, error messages, terminal output, API keys, configuration values, URLs, and Stack Overflow answers. Without a clipboard history, each new copy overwrites the last.

**Common workflows:**
- **Code snippets** -- Copy a function or code block, then copy something else for reference. Both are saved and searchable. Use the Code filter to see only code clips.
- **Error messages** -- Copy an error from the console, search for a fix, copy the solution. If you need the original error again, it is still in your history.
- **Terminal commands** -- Save frequently used commands by pinning them. `docker-compose up -d`, SSH connections, git commands -- all accessible with one click.
- **API responses** -- Copy JSON responses for comparison. The extension auto-detects JSON, so you can filter to see only JSON clips.
- **Multiple files** -- When refactoring, you often need to move code between files. Copy several pieces, then paste them where needed from your history.
- **URLs** -- Copying documentation links, PR URLs, or Jira ticket links throughout the day. The URL filter shows all of them at a glance.

## Writers and Content Creators

Writers work with many pieces of text simultaneously -- research quotes, draft paragraphs, reference links, notes, and source material. Clipboard History turns the clipboard into a working scratchpad.

**Common workflows:**
- **Research collection** -- Copy quotes, statistics, and passages from multiple sources while researching. All of them are saved and searchable, so you do not need to switch between tabs.
- **Draft paragraphs** -- Write a paragraph, cut it, write another version, then decide which one to keep. Both versions are in your history.
- **Notes and outlines** -- Copy bullet points and headings from notes into your document. Each piece is available for re-use.
- **Source attribution** -- Copy author names, titles, and URLs for citations. Search your history for a source you copied earlier instead of navigating back to it.
- **Social media** -- Keep hashtag sets, post templates, and captions pinned for quick access when posting across platforms.

## Virtual Assistants and Remote Workers

Virtual assistants handle repetitive communication -- email templates, client details, meeting links, and standard responses. Clipboard History reduces the time spent finding and re-typing common text.

**Common workflows:**
- **Email templates** -- Pin your most-used email templates. Open Clipboard History, click the template, and paste it into your email client.
- **Client information** -- Copy client names, addresses, or account numbers once. They stay in your history for the rest of the day.
- **Repeated responses** -- Customer-facing roles require the same answers to the same questions. Pin your top 10 responses and paste them with two clicks.
- **Meeting links** -- Pin your Zoom or Google Meet link so you can paste it into every calendar invite and chat message without searching for it.
- **Form filling** -- When entering the same data across multiple platforms (CRMs, spreadsheets, emails), your clipboard history keeps everything available.

## Students and Researchers

Students juggle lecture notes, textbook quotes, paper citations, and assignment content. Clipboard History keeps everything accessible.

**Common workflows:**
- **Research papers** -- Copy quotes and data points from journal articles, PDFs, and web sources. Search your clipboard history to find that statistic you copied three hours ago.
- **Citations** -- Copy author names, publication dates, and titles from databases. They are all in your history when you write your bibliography.
- **Note-taking** -- Copy key concepts from online lectures or slides. Review them later by searching your clipboard history.
- **Collaboration** -- Copy feedback from peers, paste responses, and re-use your own comments across documents.
- **Coding assignments** -- For computer science students, the same developer workflows apply. Pin starter code, copy test cases, and keep error messages accessible.

## Customer Support

Support agents copy and paste solutions, links, and account details dozens of times per day. Clipboard History makes this faster.

**Common workflows:**
- **Canned responses** -- Pin your top troubleshooting steps, greeting templates, and closing messages. Paste them without opening a separate document.
- **Knowledge base links** -- Copy and pin links to your most-referenced help articles. Paste them into tickets or chat sessions instantly.
- **Account details** -- Copy a customer's name, email, or ticket number once. It stays in your history as you work through their issue across multiple tools.
- **Escalation templates** -- Pin the format your team uses for escalation notes so you can paste and fill it in quickly.
- **Multi-tool workflows** -- Support agents often switch between a ticketing system, chat, email, and internal tools. Clipboard History keeps your copied content accessible across all of them within Chrome.
